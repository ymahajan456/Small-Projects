    VHDL files for the multiplier
    and its testbench.

	ShiftAddMultiplier.vhdl

	Testbench.vhdl
		This testbench reads A,B, RESULT from
                TRACEFILE.txt, applies it to the DUT,
                and checks the result.

	compile_ghdl.sh
		run ./compile_ghdl.sh to compile.  This
                produces an executable called testbench.

		To run
                ./testbench --stop-time=10000ns --wave=run.ghw
                (this reports success/failure, and creates a waveform file)
   
	TRACEFILE.txt
		A,B, RESULT I/Os
